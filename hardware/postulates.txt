1. Associated with any partical ina conservation field of force is a wave function which dtermines everything that can be known about the system

2. With every physical oberservable q there is associated an operator Q, which when operating upon the wavefunction associated with a definite value of that observable will yield the value times the wavefunction.

3. Any operator Q associated with a physically measurable property q will be hermitian.

4. The set of eigenfunctions of operator Q will form a complete set of linearly independant functions.

5. For a system described by a given wavefunction, the expectation value of any property q can be found by performing the expectation value integral with respect to tha wavefunction

6. The time evolution of the wavefunction is given by the time dependant Schrodinger equation
