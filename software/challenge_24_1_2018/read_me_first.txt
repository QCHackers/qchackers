The files in this folder are the template and instruction files 
for the QISKit Developer Challenge. 
You should start by running the Jupyter Notebook 'HowTo-QISKit_Developer_Challenge.ipynb'. 
Should you not have Jupyter installed you can either 
use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to display the notebook contents or 
download and install Jupyter from jupyter.org. 
To learn more about the Quantum Information Software Kit visit https://www.qiskit.org/.
Details about the Quantum Contest Program can be found on http://qe-awards.mybluemix.net/.

Your compiler code should replace the compiler_function in challenge_submission.py.
challenge_evaluation.py is used to grade and test your compiler code.

Your submission will consist in the modified challenge_submission.py 
together with any required helper files.

Good Luck!



Updated on 22 January 2018:
