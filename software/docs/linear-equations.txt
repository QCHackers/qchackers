1. Phase estimation
2. Controlled rotation
3. Inverse phase estimation



1. Phase estimation


Prepares an eigenstate of the herimitian operator in one register and stores the corresponding eigenvalue in a second register.



Phase estimation for a single-qubit Hamiltonian 0~ x acting on Q2. Q3 serves as a pointer system. The quantum Fourier transform on the pointer system in equivalent to the hadamard gate H on Q#. The discretized evolution of the system+pointer system is described by th


The final measurement outcome on the pointer Q3 is 0 or 1 dependinig on whether Q2 is prepared in the +1 or -1 eigenstate of 0~x



Controlled rotation R evolves the into a state

The inverse phase estimation restores the register.

The vector x, the solution of the system can be obtained by conditioning the solution of the system of linear equations



H 3
CNOT 3 2
CNOT 2 1



A = ([1.5, 0.5] [0.5, 1.5])
eigenvalue(A) = lambda_1 = 2 and lambda_2 = 1

1 and 2 can be stored with two qubits in registers.

The phase estimation subroutine can be compiled into  two controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, a swap gate, and three single qubit rotation gates

|b>

|b1> = 1/sqrt(2) * ([1], [1])

|b2> = 1/sqrt(2) * ([1], [-1])

|b3 = ([1], [0])

The matrix A is choses such as its values 1 and 2 are encoded with two qubits in the registers



Rotation subroutine
